# Privacy-Preserving COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Differential Privacy

This project leverages Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to analyze and predict COVID-19 patient risks using a large-scale dataset. By incorporating algorithms such as Gaussian Noise, Report Noisy Max, and the Exponential Mechanism, we ensure the protection of sensitive patient information while providing meaningful insights. This project addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving data analysis in healthcare, balancing privacy with actionable utility.
